# CoDaS-HEP-Perf-Tuning

  Sample Matrix-Matrix multiplication code for CoDaS-HEP Summer School

  This is intended to use as a example to profile with performance tuning tools such as VTune.  
  The code does not do anything useful and is for illustrative/educational use only.  It is not meant 
  to be exhaustive or demostrating optimal matrix-matrix multiplication techniques.
